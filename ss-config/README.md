# ss-config
`ss-config` is a cross-platform tool for generating systemd unit files for installing Safe Surfer on servers. `values.yaml` contains all the possible configuration options, and largely mirrors the format of the Helm chart's `values.yaml` file, but only supporting DNS. For usage instructions, see the [getting started guide](../guides/getting-started.md).
